Advent of Code day 2 was a fun one. The explanation for part two took me a whie to wrap my head around,but once I did, the rest was pretty straightforward.

Though I did an ok job, at first. Refactored 3 or 4 times to come up with something that I'm mostly happy with.

Got my gold stars, then checked out reddit for other solutions.

Wow. After looking at a few great answers - I overengineered the shit out of this. I wasn't going for speed, so I could afford to write some seriously verbose code.

Since it's so large, it's probably hard to read. I've included a link to the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qxyjYj6cE8P2AaDPQuK42J-P5kJ0v9Po) that I used to work through this problem if that's easier to read.

Either way, here's the code in it's entirety.

## My Solution

```python
unique_intcode = '1,0,0,3,1,1,2,3,1,3,4,3,1,5,0,3,2,1,10,19,1,19,5,23,2,23,9,27,1,5,27,31,1,9,31,35,1,35,10,39,2,13,39,43,1,43,9,47,1,47,9,51,1,6,51,55,1,13,55,59,1,59,13,63,1,13,63,67,1,6,67,71,1,71,13,75,2,10,75,79,1,13,79,83,1,83,10,87,2,9,87,91,1,6,91,95,1,9,95,99,2,99,10,103,1,103,5,107,2,6,107,111,1,111,6,115,1,9,115,119,1,9,119,123,2,10,123,127,1,127,5,131,2,6,131,135,1,135,5,139,1,9,139,143,2,143,13,147,1,9,147,151,1,151,2,155,1,9,155,0,99,2,0,14,0'
