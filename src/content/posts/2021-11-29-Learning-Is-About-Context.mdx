Early on in my career, a mentor said to me, "I'm not sure why it works, but I know it does. When you teach kids the same thing in a bunch of different ways - they get it." 10 years later, I'm finally able to articulate why they were right.

If I remember correctly, that mentor was a proponent of the "multiple modalities" approach to teaching new content. Personally, I've found 90% of educators who follow this line of thinking do it wrong. Showing a powerpoint while students fill in guided notes and play with a tactile does *technically* use multiple modalities - but it's missing the point.

We don't want to give students lots of things to do at once, we want to improve their ability to develop the context needed to internalize difficult concepts.

My line of thinking can be summarized with three core principles:

1. To learn anything new, our brains need sufficient scaffolding
2. Doing the same activity multiple times is boring and drains our energy
3. Seeing things from multiple perspectives improves the robustness of our mental models

## Developing Context

Without the proper context, we don't retain anything we learn. Don't take my word for it, look at the science.

Professor Thad A. Polk from the University of Michigan highlights how what we already know impacts our ability to understand new content. He begins by discussing a famous experiment conducted by John Bransford and Marcia Johnson.

Three different groups were read the same passage. Read it yourself, and see if you can figure out what it's talking about before skipping ahead. No cheating!

> The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange things into different groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities that is the next step, otherwise you are pretty well set. It is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem important but complications can easily arise. A mistake can be expensive as well. At first the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then one never can tell. After the procedure is completed one arranges the materials into different groups again. Then they can be put into their appropriate places. Eventually they will be used once more and the whole cycle will then have to be repeated. However, that is part of life.

Don't know what that paragraph was about? You're not alone.

Spoiler - it's about **washing clothes**. 

With that knowledge in mind, a lot of this passage becomes significantly clearer. Organizing items into different groups, expensive screw ups, etc.

Each of the three groups in the study was then asked to recall as much of the passage as they could remember. Group A was told nothing about the subject before or after the reading. Group B was also told nothing before hearing the passage. However, they were informed that the passage was about cleaning *after* having heard it, but before being asked to remember it. And group C was provided the subject before listening to the passage.

So how did they do?

Well, unsurprisingly the group told that the paragraph was about washing clothes prior to hearing it (Group C) did the best. They remembered, on average, about 6 of the steps. The group that was never informed of the topic (Group A) remembered an average of 3 concepts. So a 2X improvement. 

What is truly interesting is how last group did. Group B found out the topic of the passage after hearing it, so we should expect them to perform better, right? Well actually, that's not what happened. They also remembered on average about 3 concepts - half of group C.

The conclusion? Proper context must be established **before** learning new content, or performance suffers greatly. Relevant knowledge helps us learn when we are encoding new knowledge into memory. More than a few researchers have proposed reasons for this, and I've added a few of those papers to the footnotes section of this post.

For students, this is the most important concept to drive home. Without the proper context, students won't internalize concepts well.

This is the main reason why my mentor was correct. 

Seeing the same thing multiple times allows students to build context incrementally. Each time students complete another activity or read another article, they establish a stronger foundation for the content they're engaging with. This makes it easier to consume, process, and encode new information - allowing students to relate ideas to their previous knowledge more effectively.

## Emotions Factor Into Learning

Learning the same thing in the same way is boring. A student didn't do well on an assignment? Asking them to do the same assignment again offers little motivation.

Recent research into this field has shown that our emotional state factors strongly into our ability to encode new information during active learning. In particular, this [paper]() by Tyng, Amin, Saad. and Malik expounds on emotions' role in "moduling the selectivity of attention". Anyone who has taught a classroom of high schoolers knows how important that is.

Emotions have a stark effect on memory. Think back to one of your most embarrassing moments (If you don't have any, congratulations - you can skip this part and host your own TED talk.). Chances are, the scene that's encoded in your brain is intertwined with a rich palette of feelings. We tend to remember emotionally charged moments far more strongly than we do relatively benign ones. By the way, that doesn't mean we remember them more *accurately*. Most people old enough to remember can tell you where they were and what they were doing when JFK was shot. Or when 9/11 took the lives of over 3000 Americans. 

These moments are seared in our brains because of the emotions that are tied to that event. The important takeway here is that our emotional state matters when we learn. Besides creating a safe and welcoming environment for students, educators can craft their learning experiences with this concept in mind.

So how do we avoid the repetitive nature of doing the same thing again so that it's easier to encode knowledge with added context? Offer multiple activities that touch on the same concept but provide a unique interface to ingesting content.

The best way to keep students engaged is to make the learning fresh - and frame it appropriately. Students didn't take away the core concepts from our lesson on covalent bonds? That's ok. 

My mentor recommended using some variation of this approach when in that situation:

**Teacher**: Seems like you guys didn't quite get this material. That's ok, maybe the lesson didn't present it in a way that made sense for you. It's probably a good time to try another activity that approaches this concept from a different angle.
 

Subtly, a few things are being said here:
1. It's ok not to understand something the first time students learn it.
2. Just because students didn't "get it" doesn't mean they're dumb or bad students. Maybe it was the lesson format.
3. There's nothing wrong with trying to learn things multiple times.

More often that not, students are comfortable with this. The onus of learning is still on the student, but it alleviates a lot of the pressure associated with in-class learning.

Sometimes, it takes rounds of this process before students feel comfortable enough with the material to move on. More often than not, they come out on the other sounds sufficiently prepared for an assessment. Though the reason for this outcome is probably more nuanced than I'd like to make it, I have a simplified theory on why.

## Diversifying Perspectives Increases Robustness

Each time we learn something new and encode information into working memory, we are molding and defining a mental model. That mental architecture is only as good as the representations used to construct it. For instance, students learning about ...


I call this approach "volume learning"

Say we're teaching students babout evolution and natural selection. Having students read the same article and answer the same set of questions multiple times would bore them to death. An improved approach would look something like this:

- Start with an activity where students are given 30 seconds to pick up 1000 different colored toothpicks out of the grass. Chances are that a much larger number of red toothpicks will be gathered than, say, green ones. The instructor can then lead a conversation on what advantage certain colored toothpicks had in being "eaten".
- Then students could read an article about an alien life form
- An additional activity would involve an experiment
- Afterwards an online PHET simulation showing how mutations
- DNA polymerase mistakes lead to random variations, some of which lead to advantageous genes and phenotypes.
- Read an article on galapagos island finches each with beaks that offer an advantage in eating particular seeds.
- 

Each of these different activities offers insight into a different layer and scope of how evolution and natural selection works. It's not essential that students learn every layer in and out. However, it does refine their mental model in ways that increase the robustness of their overall understanding. 

What my mentor found is that every new perspective offers an additional opportunity for that "click" moment to happen for students. The overall picture fo what's happening crystalizes enough that they're able to explain how the underlying pieces work together to create the phenomenon they're examining. 

That doesn't mean misconceptions don't exist. In my mind, that's where great teachers offer the most value. Identifying and correcting those misunderstandings for students through assessment, feedback, and interaction.
