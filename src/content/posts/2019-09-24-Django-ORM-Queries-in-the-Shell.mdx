In the last year I took over a Django project with about 200k LOC. The team and I have since added almost 100k more LOC in new features. Accordingly, the complexity of our Django models has grown significantly. 

Much of the time, when I'm looking to add a new feature, I'll run through the relationships between models in the shell. It has saved me a ton of headaches and makes working with Django that much more enjoyable.

Here's how easy it is to jump into the shell and explore your data:

> Since I use docker to containerize all my projects, the first couple steps are docker specific. 

## Navigate to the docker container 

First, start up your app.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Next, find all the running processes.

```bash
docker ps
```

The output will look something like this:


Find the CONTAINER_ID that matches the server for your django app. Then execute this command to navigate into the terminal for the correct container:

```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```

And finally

```bash
./manage.py shell
```

Amazing. And now we're inside the python shell and can start playing with our database. Here's some example queries that might be useful to start off with.


```python
from ecommerce.api.models import Item, Cart
```

```python
Item.objects.all()
```

```python
item = Item.objects.get(pk=1)
```

```python
cart = Cart()
```

```python
cart.add_item(item)
```

```python
cart.show_items()
```

Or for a different different app...

```python
from sports_team.api.models import Player, Team
```

```python
Team.objects.all()
```

```python
team = Team()
```

```python
player1 = Player('Jeff')
player2 = Player('Shadira')
player3 = Player('Jenny')
```

```python
team.add_members([player1, player2, player3])
```

```python
team.display_members()
```

Want to get down to some raw SQL? No problem

```python
user_profiles = UserProfile.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM project_user_profile')
```

```python
for profile in user_profiles: print(profile)
```

> WARNING: No checking is done on the SQL statement that is passed in to .raw(). Django expects that the statement will return a set of rows from the database, but does nothing to enforce that. If the query does not return rows, a (possibly cryptic) error will result.
