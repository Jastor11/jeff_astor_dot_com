Welcome to Part 3 of Up and Running with FastAPI. If you missed part 2, you can find it [here](/blog/pairing-a-postgresql-db-with-your-dockerized-fastapi-app).

This series is focused on building a full-stack application with the FastAPI framework. The app allows users to post requests to have their residence cleaned, and other users can select a cleaning project for a given hourly rate.

<FastAPISeriesList upTo={3} />

Last time we left off, we setup our postgresql database and configured our migration running with alembic and sqlalchemy. In this post, we'll add CRUD endpoints to our cleanings router and hook them up to the database. Additionally, we'll create a cleanings repository that will interface with our db, and execute any related SQL queries. FastAPI depends on [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for data validation, so we'll also need to use the library to construct models for our cleanings resource.

We'll begin at the data level and work our way outward.

## FastAPI and Pydantic

For each resource, we'll describe how it should look and behave at various stages of our application. FastAPI explains how to use Pydantic in their docs:

"_You declare the 'shape' of the data as classes with attributes._

_And each attribute has a type._

_Then you create an instance of that class with some values and it will validate the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if that's the case) and give you an object with all the data._"

These Pydantic models should live in their own directory and be namespaced according to the resource. We'll also create a `core.py` file to store any common logic shared across all models.

```shell
mkdir backend/app/models
touch backend/app/models/__init__.py backend/app/models/core.py backend/app/models/cleaning.py
```

In the `core.py` file, add the following code:

```python:title=<span>models/core.py</span>
from pydantic import BaseModel


class CoreModel(BaseModel):
    """
    Any common logic to be shared by all models goes here.
    """
    pass


class IDModelMixin(BaseModel):
    id: int

```

From the outset, these look like simple python [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), and for the most part they are. For those who are less familiar, dataclasses are just classes that contain primarily data. For example, the following two dataclasses (taken from the python docs) are essentially identical - save for a few minor differences.

```python
@dataclass
class InventoryItem:
    """Class for keeping track of an item in inventory."""
    name: str
    unit_price: float
    quantity_on_hand: int = 0

    def total_cost(self) -> float:
        return self.unit_price * self.quantity_on_hand


class Item:
    def __init__(self, *, name: str, unit_price: float, quantity_on_hand: int = 0) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.unit_price = unit_price
        self.quantity_on_hand = quantity_on_hand

    def total_cost(self) -> float:
        return self.unit_price * self.quantity_on_hand
```

For anyone unfamiliar with the `*` syntax in function declarations, the FastAPI [docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#order-the-parameters-as-you-need-tricks) do a nice job of explaining its use. Any parameter that appears after the `*` should be called as a keyword argument, and doesn't require a default value.

Pydantic's `BaseModel` builds on dataclasses by by offering additional functionality around data validation and data type coercion. The Pydantic docs tell us:

> You can think of models as similar to types in strictly typed languages, or as the requirements of a single endpoint in an API. Untrusted data can be passed to a model, and after parsing and validation pydantic guarantees that the fields of the resultant model instance will conform to the field types defined on the model.

Almost every new model we create will inherit from `CoreModel` to enable us share logic across models at any point down the road. This feature will come in handy later on.

The `IDModelMixin` class will be used for all resources coming out of the database. By not providing a default value for the `id` attribute, we're telling Pydantic that this field is required for all new instances. Since we used the `int` type declaration, the Pydantic docs tell us that "Strings, bytes or floats will be coerced to ints if possible; otherwise an exception will be raised."

Let's make a few more Pydantic models to get a feel for this.

Update the `cleaning.py` file:

```python:title=<span>models/cleaning.py</span>
from typing import Optional
from enum import Enum

from app.models.core import IDModelMixin, CoreModel


class CleaningType(str, Enum):
    dust_up = "dust_up"
    spot_clean = "spot_clean"
    full_clean = "full_clean"


class CleaningBase(CoreModel):
    """
    All common characteristics of our Cleaning resource
    """
    name: Optional[str]
    description: Optional[str]
    price: Optional[float]
    cleaning_type: Optional[CleaningType] = "spot_clean"


class CleaningCreate(CleaningBase):
    name: str
    price: float


class CleaningUpdate(CleaningBase):
    cleaning_type: Optional[CleaningType]


class CleaningInDB(IDModelMixin, CleaningBase):
    name: str
    price: float
    cleaning_type: CleaningType


class CleaningPublic(IDModelMixin, CleaningBase):
    pass

```

Our `CleaningBase` model inherits from `CoreModel`, while `CleaningCreate`, `CleaningUpdate`, `CleaningInDB`, and `CleaningPublic` all inherit from `CleaningBase`. We use the `Optional` type declaration to specify that any attribute not passed in when creating the model instance will be set to `None`. To provide a clearer example, check out these two Pydantic classes that are functionally identical.

```python
class CleaningBase(CoreModel):
    """
    All common characteristics of our Cleaning resource
    """
    name: Optional[str]
    description: Optional[str]
    price: Optional[float]
    cleaning_type: Optional[CleaningType] = "spot_clean"


class CleaningBase(CoreModel):
    """
    All common characteristics of our Cleaning resource
    """
    name: str = None
    description: str = None
    price: float = None
    cleaning_type: CleaningType = "spot_clean"
```

We've also defined a custom `CleaningType` class that can only take 3 values. Any time we want to restrict the number of valid inputs to an explicit set, we'll import `Enum` and create a sub-class that inherits from our data type of choice (`str` in this case) and from `Enum`.

The 5 model types we just defined demonstrate a pattern that will be used for almost every resource:

- **Base** - all shared attributes of a resource
- **Create** - attributes required to create a new resource - used at POST requests
- **Update** - attributes that can be updated - used at PUT requests
- **InDB** - attributes present on any resource coming out of the database
- **Public** - attributes present on public facing resources being returned from GET, POST, and PUT requests

With our models in place, we are now ready to craft a database interface accordingly.

## Repositories

The purpose of a repository is to serve as a layer of abstraction on top of database actions. Each repository encapsulates database functionality corresponding to a particular resource. In doing so, we decouple persistence logic from our application logic. The [Repository Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html), introduced in [Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) back in 2004, has a number of popular implementations. For Phresh, we'll stick to a slightly customized approach and treat repositories as a stand-in for a more traditional ORM.

We'll start by setting up a base repository, and then we'll move on to our cleanings repository.

Create a `cleanings.py` file in the `repositories` directory.

```bash
touch backend/app/db/repositories/cleanings.py
```

Our `BaseRepository` will be a simple class needed only to keep a reference to our database connection. In the future we can add functionality for common db actions, but we'll keep it lightweight for now. In `base.py` add the following:

```python:title=<span>db/repositories/base.py</span>
from databases import Database


class BaseRepository:
    def __init__(self, db: Database) -> None:
        self.db = db

```

Nothing special is happening here, and that's fine. In the `repositories/cleanings.py` file, add this:

```python:title=<span>db/repositories/cleanings.py</span>
from app.db.repositories.base import BaseRepository
from app.models.cleaning import CleaningCreate, CleaningUpdate, CleaningInDB


CREATE_CLEANING_QUERY = """
    INSERT INTO cleanings (name, description, price, cleaning_type)
    VALUES (:name, :description, :price, :cleaning_type)
    RETURNING id, name, description, price, cleaning_type;
"""


class CleaningsRepository(BaseRepository):
    """"
    All database actions associated with the Cleaning resource
    """

    async def create_cleaning(self, *, new_cleaning: CleaningCreate) -> CleaningInDB:
        query_values = new_cleaning.dict()
        cleaning = await self.db.fetch_one(query=CREATE_CLEANING_QUERY, values=query_values)

        return CleaningInDB(**cleaning)

```

Now we're getting somewhere. We're importing our `BaseRepository` and a few models associated with the Cleaning resource. We've also written our first SQL query, complete with the `:query_arg` style that the [databases](https://www.encode.io/databases/database_queries/) package expects. One of the benefits of using the Repository pattern is that we get the flexibility of pure SQL, with the clean interface of an ORM.

The `CleaningsRepository` that we've created inherits from our `BaseRepository` and defines a single method meant to insert a new cleaning into our postgres database. Notice how our `create_cleaning` method expects a `new_cleaning` argument that is type annotated using the `CleaningCreate` model. We first call the `.dict()` method on our model to convert it to a dictionary. There's quite a bit we can do when exporting Pydantic models in this way, so curious readers should feel free to read up on it in the [docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/exporting_models/#modeldict).

In a nutshell, here's what happens when we create a Pydantic model and call `.dict()` on it.

```python
new_cleaning = CleaningCreate(name="Clean My House", cleaning_type="full_clean", price="29.99")
query_values = new_cleaning.dict()
print(query_values)
# {"name": "Clean My House", "cleaning_type": "full_clean", "price": 29.99, "description": None}
```

Pydantic parses and validates our inputs, fills in default values, and converts the model into a dictionary. Each of the keys in this dictionary map neatly to the query arguments in our `CREATE_CLEANING_QUERY` SQL query, meaning most of the work is done for us.

We then create the cleaning by using the `db.fetch_one` method that the `databases` package provides us, passing in the query we want to execute, and the associated query args. Finally, we take the database record that is returned from our SQL query and unpack it using the `**cleaning` syntax. What this does is take each key-value pair in the record and turn them into keyword arguments for our `CleaningInDB` instance.

So, where is the `CleaningsRepository` getting its database reference seen in `self.db.fetch_one`? Well, we haven't handled that yet. Every repository is going to need access to the postgres, and fortunately FastAPI provides a clean and powerful dependency injection system that handles this setup relatively seamlessly.

## Dependencies in FastAPI Endpoints

The FastAPI [docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/) tell us:

> "Dependency Injection" means, in programming, that there is a way for your code (in this case, your path operation functions) to declare things that it requires to work and use: "dependencies".

Every API endpoint we define is going to need access to our database - making our postgres db the perfect candidate for a dependency.

Those unfamiliar with FastAPI are **strongly** encouraged to read the dependencies docs linked above, as they go into explicit detail on the dependency injection system - which we will not do here.

When ready, make a new `dependencies` directory inside of `api`, and create 2 new files.

```bash
mkdir backend/app/api/dependencies
touch backend/app/api/dependencies/__init__.py backend/app/api/dependencies/database.py
```

Inside of our new `database.py` file, add the following:

```python:title=<span>api/dependencies/database.py</span>
from typing import Callable, Type
from databases import Database

from fastapi import Depends
from starlette.requests import Request

from app.db.repositories.base import BaseRepository


def get_database(request: Request) -> Database:
    return request.app.state._db


def get_repository(Repo_type: Type[BaseRepository]) -> Callable:
    def get_repo(db: Database = Depends(get_database)) -> Type[BaseRepository]:
        return Repo_type(db)

    return get_repo

```

We have two dependencies here: `get_database` and `get_repository`. FastAPI dependencies are just functions - or more accurately `Callables` - which are called as API endpoint [path parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params/).

They probably look pretty funky to the uninitiated, so don't worry about understanding this all quite yet. It'll make more sense once we actually get to using them.

Head into the `api/routes/cleanings.py` file and update it accordingly.

```python:title=<span>api/routes/cleanings.py</span>
from typing import List

from fastapi import APIRouter, Body, Depends  # highlight-line
from starlette.status import HTTP_201_CREATED  # highlight-line

from app.models.cleaning import CleaningCreate, CleaningPublic  # highlight-line
from app.db.repositories.cleanings import CleaningsRepository  # highlight-line
from app.api.dependencies.database import get_repository  # highlight-line


router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/")
async def get_all_cleanings() -> List[dict]:
    cleanings = [
        {"id": 1, "name": "My house", "cleaning_type": "full_clean", "price_per_hour": 29.99},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Someone else's house", "cleaning_type": "spot_clean", "price_per_hour": 19.99}
    ]

    return cleanings


# highlight-start
@router.post("/", response_model=CleaningPublic, name="cleanings:create-cleaning", status_code=HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def create_new_cleaning(
    new_cleaning: CleaningCreate = Body(..., embed=True),
    cleanings_repo: CleaningsRepository = Depends(get_repository(CleaningsRepository)),
) -> CleaningPublic:
    created_cleaning = await cleanings_repo.create_cleaning(new_cleaning=new_cleaning)

    return created_cleaning
# highlight-end
```

Things are starting to heat up now. Our new POST route is significantly more fleshed out than the dummy route - and for good reason.

While we break down what's actually going on, let's pull up the OpenAPI docs that FastAPI generates for our new endpoint. Head to `localhost:8000/docs` and check out the automatic, interactive, API documentation provided to us for free.

<figure>
  <img src="https://storage.cloud.google.com/jeff-astor.appspot.com/open_api_docs_phresh.png" alt="phresh api docs" />
</figure>

Let's click on on our newly minted POST route - should be a big green button.

FastAPI reminds us in the [request body docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/):

> A "request body is data sent by the client to your API. A response body is the data your API sends to the client."

We're shown both here - exactly what's required in the body for a successful request, and the kind of responses we can expect to see for validation errors or successful execution. The success response schema comes from `response_model=CleaningPublic`, while the success status comes from `status_code=HTTP_201_CREATED`. And the route's name comes from declaring `name="cleanings:create-cleaning"`.

All of this is standard FastAPI stuff that comes from our declarations in the POST route decorator. FastAPI handles all of this for us!

```python:title=<span>api/routes/cleanings.py</span>
@router.post("/", response_model=CleaningPublic, name="cleanings:create-cleaning", status_code=HTTP_201_CREATED)  # highlight-line
async def create_new_cleaning(
    new_cleaning: CleaningCreate = Body(..., embed=True),
    cleanings_repo: CleaningsRepository = Depends(get_repository(CleaningsRepository)),
) -> CleaningPublic:
    created_cleaning = await cleanings_repo.create_cleaning(new_cleaning=new_cleaning)

    return created_cleaning

```

The first of two path parameters in our `create_new_cleaning` function, `new_cleaning`, is annotated with the `CleaningCreate` type. By default, FastAPI expects the body of a post request directly. If we want it to expect JSON with a key `new_cleaning` and inside of it the model contents, we use the special `Body` parameter `embed` in the parameter default.

By simply specifying the `CleaningCreate` Python type declaration for `new_cleaning`, FastAPI will:

- Read the body of the request as JSON.
- Convert the corresponding types.
- Validate the data.
- Respond with an error if validation fails, or provide the route with the model instance needed.

That's a lot of functionality for very little code.

```python:title=<span>api/routes/cleanings.py</span>
@router.post("/", response_model=CleaningPublic, name="cleanings:create-cleaning", status_code=HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def create_new_cleaning(
    new_cleaning: CleaningCreate = Body(..., embed=True),  # highlight-line
    cleanings_repo: CleaningsRepository = Depends(get_repository(CleaningsRepository)),
) -> CleaningPublic:
    created_cleaning = await cleanings_repo.create_cleaning(new_cleaning=new_cleaning)

    return created_cleaning

```

The second of the two path parameters - `cleanings_repo` - is our database interface, and the route's only dependency. We're setting its default to `Depends(get_repository(CleaningsRepository))` so that we have access to it in our route and can create the new cleaning whenever the function is executed. FastAPI automatically validates and converts the `created_cleaning` to an instance of our `CleaningPublic` model, and sends the appropriate JSON as a response.

```python:title=<span>api/routes/cleanings.py</span>
@router.post("/", response_model=CleaningPublic, name="cleanings:create-cleaning", status_code=HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def create_new_cleaning(
    new_cleaning: CleaningCreate = Body(..., embed=True),
    cleanings_repo: CleaningsRepository = Depends(get_repository(CleaningsRepository)),  # highlight-line
) -> CleaningPublic:
    created_cleaning = await cleanings_repo.create_cleaning(new_cleaning=new_cleaning)

    return created_cleaning

```

Getting back to **dependencies** - FastAPI understands that our route _depends_ on the `CleaningsRepository` returned by the `get_repository` function. Recall how we defined that function in our `dependencies.py` file. It probably makes sense to return to that file, now that we have a better understanding of its purpose.

```python:title=<span>api/dependencies/database.py</span>
from typing import Callable, Type
from databases import Database

from fastapi import Depends
from starlette.requests import Request

from app.db.repositories.base import BaseRepository


def get_database(request: Request) -> Database:  # highlight-line
    return request.app.state._db  # highlight-line

# highlight-start
def get_repository(Repo_type: Type[BaseRepository]) -> Callable:
    def get_repo(db: Database = Depends(get_database)) -> Type[BaseRepository]:
        return Repo_type(db)

    return get_repo
# highlight-end

```

In the `get_repository` function, we declare a single `Repo_type` parameter and return another function called `get_repo`. The `get_repo` has _its own_ dependency - `db` - declared as a single parameter. This is known in FastAPI as a [sub-dependency](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/) and depends on the `get_database` function, which grabs a reference to our database connection that we established in our app's startup event handler.

The `Request` object comes directly from the `starlette` framework, and FastAPI handles passing that along for us. Read more about how to use the `Request` object directly [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/using-request-directly/).

We then pass that database reference to our `CleaningsRepository` and let the repo interface with the postgres db as needed.

## Testing Our Route

The OpenAPI docs also provide us with a 'Try it out' button that allows us to execute any request with some dummy data. We click on the route, edit the JSON with whatever data we to send to our API, hit the execute button, and it should issue a POST request against the route we just created.

> If we forgot to migrate our database, we'll get a 500 Internal Server error thrown from `asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedTableError`. The hint that follows it - `relation "cleanings" does not exist` - is letting us know that we need to run our migrations to create the cleanings table in our database. See the end of the last [post](/blog/pairing-a-postgresql-db-with-your-dockerized-fastapi-app) for instructions on how to do that.

Let's open up psql in our db container and make sure things worked according to plan.

```bash
docker-compose exec db psql -h localhost -U postgres --dbname=postgres
```

Once connected, we'll query our database for all cleaning records.

```sql
SELECT id, name, description, cleaning_type, price FROM cleanings;
```

Lovely! We've created a cleaning and persisted it in our database. And just like that, we've completed our first API endpoint and tested it using FastAPI's interactive docs.

## Wrapping Up and Resources

This is a pattern we'll employ for every resource. Structure our database, design our resource repository, and build our Pydantic models. Afterwards, we flesh out our endpoints and integrate our models and db interface, testing pieces of it along the way.

Having finished a lot of the grunt work needed to build our app's foundation, we'll spend the next few posts adding features and functionality. We'll also establish some development best practices by implementing proper testing protocols using `pytest` and `Docker`. Stay tuned.
