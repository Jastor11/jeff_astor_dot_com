Welcome to Part 24 of Up and Running with FastAPI. If you missed part 23, you can find it [here](/blog/refactoring-our-react-ui-into-composable-hooks").

This series is focused on building a full-stack application with the FastAPI framework. The app allows users to post requests to have their residence cleaned, and other users can select a cleaning project for a given hourly rate.

<FastAPISeriesList upTo={24} />

Previously, we refactored the majority of our auth and UI related logic into composable hooks. Doing so made our components leaner and gave us a framework to guide future improvements to our frontend.

We'll use that same approach in this post, but we'll shift the focus towards cleaning jobs. Keep in mind that we're gearing up for handling evaluations and aggregate statistics. The bulk of the work we do here should make things easier in that regard.

## Updating the cleanings redux slice

Currently, the process by which we manage and view individual cleaning jobs is clunky. We're going to clean up our `redux/cleanings.js` file a bit and then follow the pattern we adopted in our last post, moving logic out of components and into custom hooks.

Before we begin, tweak the `redux/initialState.js` file slightly.

```jsx:title=<span>redux/initialState.js</span>
export default {
  auth: {
    isLoading: false,
    isUpdating: false,
    isAuthenticated: false,
    error: null,
    userLoaded: false,
    user: {}
  },
  cleanings: {
    isLoading: false,
    isUpdating: false,
    error: null,
    data: {},
    activeCleaningId: null  // highlight-line
  },
  offers: {
    isLoading: false,
    isUpdating: false,
    error: null,
    data: {}
  },
  feed: {
    isLoading: false,
    error: null,
    data: {},
    hasNext: {}
  },
  ui: {
    toastList: []
  }
}

```

Just a one line change that precludes what's to come in our `redux` refactor.

Ok, now let's pop open that `redux/cleanings.js` file and make a few changes.

```jsx:title=<span>redux/cleanings.js</span>
// highlight-start
import initialState from "redux/initialState"
import { REQUEST_LOG_USER_OUT } from "redux/auth"
import apiClient from "services/apiClient"
// highlight-end

// ...other code

export default function cleaningsReducer(state = initialState.cleanings, action = {}) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCH_CLEANING_JOB_BY_ID:
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: true
      }
		// highlight-start
    case FETCH_CLEANING_JOB_BY_ID_SUCCESS:
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        error: null,
        data: {
          ...state.data,
          [action.data.id]: action.data,
        },
        activeCleaningId: action.data.id,
      }
    case FETCH_CLEANING_JOB_BY_ID_FAILURE:
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        error: action.error,
      }
		case CLEAR_CURRENT_CLEANING_JOB:
			return {
				...state,
				activeCleaningId: null,
			}
		// highlight-end

		// ...other code

		// highlight-start
    case UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB_SUCCESS:
      return {
        ...state,
        isUpdating: false,
        error: null,
        data: {
          ...state.data,
          [action.data.id]: action.data,
        }
      }
		// highlight-end

		// ...other code

    default:
      return state
  }
}

export const Actions = {}

Actions.clearCurrentCleaningJob = () => ({ type: CLEAR_CURRENT_CLEANING_JOB })

Actions.createCleaningJob = ({ newCleaning }) => {  // highlight-line
  return apiClient({
    url: `/cleanings/`,
    method: `POST`,
    types: {
      REQUEST: CREATE_CLEANING_JOB,
      SUCCESS: CREATE_CLEANING_JOB_SUCCESS,
      FAILURE: CREATE_CLEANING_JOB_FAILURE
    },
    options: {
      data: { new_cleaning: newCleaning },  // highlight-line
      params: {}
    }
  })
}

Actions.fetchCleaningJobById = ({ cleaningId }) => { // highlight-line
  return apiClient({
    url: `/cleanings/${cleaningId}/`, // highlight-line
    method: `GET`,
    types: {
      REQUEST: FETCH_CLEANING_JOB_BY_ID,
      SUCCESS: FETCH_CLEANING_JOB_BY_ID_SUCCESS,
      FAILURE: FETCH_CLEANING_JOB_BY_ID_FAILURE
    },
    options: {
      data: {},
      params: {}
    }
  })
}

Actions.updateCleaningJob = ({ cleaningId, cleaningUpdate }) => { // highlight-line
  return apiClient({
    url: `/cleanings/${cleaningId}/`, // highlight-line
    method: `PUT`,
    types: {
      REQUEST: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB,
      SUCCESS: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB_SUCCESS,
      FAILURE: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB_FAILURE
    },
    options: {
      data: { cleaning_update: cleaningUpdate }, // highlight-line
      params: {}
    }
  })
}

// ...other code

```

All of the updates to our action creator functions are simply cosmetic. Mixing snake case and camel case is usually not a good idea as it makes for an inconsistent api. Now, tools like VS code will handle autocompletion for us. Even so, it's good practice to stick with standard JavaScript snake case until we need to actually pass camel case parameters to our FastAPI backend. So we've converted parameters like `cleaning_id` to `cleaningId`.

The other changes we've made are in the `cleaningsReducer`. We are also standardizing how we handle receiving cleaning resources from our FastAPI server, which is a much needed change. We'll be keeping all jobs indexed by id inside the `data` key, creating a simple lookup table when we need to access a particular resource. On top of that, we're simply storing the active id of any successfully fetched cleaning job and caching it in `activeCleaningId`. Any clunky update logic has been replace as well. All of these changes will break things as they currently stand, but that's ok. We'll fix them in a minute.

Oh yeah, we also switched to absolute imports here as well. All is well at the moment.

Next up is creating a new custom hook that we'll use to manage any individual cleaning resource.

## The useSingleCleaningJob Hook

Go ahead and create a new directory inside our hooks folder called `cleanings`. Add a new file to it called `useSingleCleaningJob.js`.

```bash
mkdir src/hooks/cleanings
touch src/hooks/cleanings/useSingleCleaningJob.js
```

While we're at it, let's also create a new file in the `utils` directory called `cleanings.js`. Over the next couple steps we'll be putting a few helper methods to good use. Now is as good a time as ever to start adding code there.

```bash
touch src/utils/cleanings.js
```

First things first, add the following code to the `useSingleCleaningJob.js` file:

```jsx:title=<span>useSingleCleaningJob.js</span>
import { useEffect } from "react"
import { useDispatch, useSelector, shallowEqual } from "react-redux"
import { useAuthenticatedUser } from "hooks/auth/useAuthenticatedUser"
import { Actions as cleaningActions } from "redux/cleanings"
import { userIsOwnerOfCleaningJob } from "utils/cleanings"

export const useSingleCleaningJob = (cleaningId) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  const { user } = useAuthenticatedUser()
  const cleaningJob = useSelector((state) => state.cleanings.data[cleaningId], shallowEqual)
	const activeCleaningId = useSelector((state) => state.cleanings.activeCleaningId)
  const isLoading = useSelector((state) => state.cleanings.isLoading)
  const isUpdating = useSelector((state) => state.cleanings.isUpdating)
  const error = useSelector((state) => state.cleanings.error, shallowEqual)
  const userIsOwner = userIsOwnerOfCleaningJob(cleaningJob, user)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (cleaningId && !cleaningJob) {
      dispatch(cleaningActions.fetchCleaningJobById({ cleaningId }))
    }

    return () => {
      dispatch(cleaningActions.clearCurrentCleaningJob())
    }
  }, [dispatch, cleaningId, cleaningJob])

  return {
    error,
    isLoading,
    isUpdating,
    cleaningJob,
    userIsOwner,
		activeCleaningId,
  }
}

```

A few things to take note of here.

At the top of the file we're importing some standard `redux` stuff and a yet-to-be-created function called `userIsOwnerOfCleaningJob`. Its job is self-explanatory. We should be able to pass it a user object and a cleaning object, and we should get back a boolean indicating whether or not that user owns the cleaning resource in question. We're also importing the `useAuthenticatedUser` hook that we defined in our previous post. Once again, centralizing our app's auth logic in this hook is proving fruitful.

The `useSingleCleaningJob` function takes in a single parameter, the id of the cleaning job. We then use that id in two places.

First, we pull the cleaning job from the `cleanings` slice of our `redux` state tree. We also grab the `isLoading` and `isUpdating` flags, along with any errors. We then pass both the cleaning job and the user returned by our `useAuthenticatedUser` hook into the `userIsOwnerOfCleaningJob` utility function to determin the value of the `userIsOwner` boolean.

Finally, we run a `useEffect` hook that checks if the `cleaningId` is valid and that we don't already have a `cleaningJob` in state. If both these conditions are met, we dispatch the `fetchCleaningJobById` action creator and request the cleaning resource from our FastAPI backend.

At the end, we return all relevant data that consumers of this hook might need.

All that's left is to implement the `userIsOwnerOfCleaningJob` function.

```jsx:title=<span>utils/cleanings.js</span>
export const userIsOwnerOfCleaningJob = (cleaning, user) => {
  if (cleaning?.owner?.id === user?.id) return true
  if (cleaning?.owner === user?.id) return true
  return false
}

```

Three situations are being accounted for here.

- When the function is provided a cleaning job where the owner is a user object, we compare the id of the owner with the id of the user passed to the function. If they match, we return `true`.
- When the cleaning job has an owner property that is only an id, we simply compare that to the id of the user and return `true` if they match.
- If neither of the two previous situations match, or if `null` or `undefined` is passed in for either the `cleaning` or `user` parameters, none of the conditions will match and the function simply returns `false`.

Now onto the tricky part. We'll need to update any component that depends on accessing a single cleaning job from `redux`.

Before we do anything else, make a small change to the `CleaningJobsPage.js` component.

```jsx:title=<span>CleaningJobsPage.js</span>
import React from "react"
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom"
import { CleaningJobsHome, CleaningJobView, NotFoundPage } from "components"

export default function CleaningJobsPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<CleaningJobsHome />} />
        <Route path=":cleaningId/*" element={<CleaningJobView />} />  // highlight-line
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  )
}

```

Here we're specifying the route param as `cleaningId` instead of `cleaning_id`. Again, we're simply staying consistent with our variable casing.

Next, open up the `CleaningJobView` component and update it like so:

```jsx:title=<span>CleaningJobView.js</span>
import React from "react"
import { Routes, Route, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"
import { useSingleCleaningJob } from "hooks/cleanings/useSingleCleaningJob"
import {
  EuiButtonEmpty,
  EuiButtonIcon,
  EuiFlexGroup,
  EuiFlexItem,
  EuiPage,
  EuiPageBody,
  EuiPageContent,
  EuiPageContentBody,
  EuiLoadingSpinner,
  EuiTitle
} from "@elastic/eui"
import {
  CleaningJobCard,
  CleaningJobEditForm,
  CleaningJobOffersTable,
  NotFoundPage,
  PermissionsNeeded,
  UserAvatar
} from "components"
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom"
import styled from "styled-components"

const StyledEuiPage = styled(EuiPage)`
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
`
const StyledFlexGroup = styled(EuiFlexGroup)`
  padding: 1rem;
`

export default function CleaningJobView() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  const { cleaningId } = useParams()
  const {
    cleaningJob,
		error,
    isLoading,
    isUpdating,
    activeCleaningId,
    userIsOwner
  } = useSingleCleaningJob(cleaningId)

  if (isLoading) return <EuiLoadingSpinner size="xl" />
  if (!cleaningJob && activeCleaningId !== cleaningId) return <NotFoundPage />

  const editJobButton = userIsOwner ? (
    <EuiButtonIcon iconType="documentEdit" aria-label="edit" onClick={() => navigate(`edit`)} />
  ) : null
  const goBackButton = (
    <EuiButtonEmpty
      iconType="sortLeft"
      size="s"
      onClick={() => navigate(`/cleaning-jobs/${cleaningJob.id}`)}
    >
      back to job
    </EuiButtonEmpty>
  )

  const viewCleaningJobElement = (
    <CleaningJobCard
      offersIsLoading={null}
      cleaningJob={cleaningJob}
      isOwner={userIsOwner}
      createOfferForCleaning={null}
      userOfferForCleaningJob={null}
    />
  )
  const editCleaningJobElement = (
    <PermissionsNeeded
      element={<CleaningJobEditForm cleaningId={cleaningId} />}
      isAllowed={userIsOwner}
    />
  )

  const cleaningJobOffersTableElement = userIsOwner ? (
    <CleaningJobOffersTable offers={[]} handleAcceptOffer={null} offersIsLoading={null} />
  ) : null

  return (
    <StyledEuiPage>
      <EuiPageBody component="section">
        <EuiPageContent verticalPosition="center" horizontalPosition="center" paddingSize="none">
          <StyledFlexGroup alignItems="center" direction="row" responsive={false}>
            <EuiFlexItem>
              <EuiFlexGroup
                justifyContent="flexStart"
                alignItems="center"
                direction="row"
                responsive={false}
              >
                <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
                  <UserAvatar size="xl" user={cleaningJob.owner} intialsLength={2} />
                </EuiFlexItem>
                <EuiFlexItem>
                  <EuiTitle>
                    <p>@{cleaningJob.owner?.username}</p>
                  </EuiTitle>
                </EuiFlexItem>
              </EuiFlexGroup>
            </EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
              <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={editJobButton} />
                <Route path="/edit" element={goBackButton} />
              </Routes>
            </EuiFlexItem>
          </StyledFlexGroup>

          <EuiPageContentBody>
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/" element={viewCleaningJobElement} />
              <Route path="/edit" element={editCleaningJobElement} />
              <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
            </Routes>
          </EuiPageContentBody>
        </EuiPageContent>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={cleaningJobOffersTableElement} />
        </Routes>
      </EuiPageBody>
    </StyledEuiPage>
  )
}

```

Compared to what this component looked like before, this is a signficant upgrade. To be fair, we've left out anything having to do with offers, so we've added a number of `null` and empty array values to children of this component. Once we start handling fetching offers for a single cleaning job, we'll update these values.

We're no longer using any `redux` related code directly in the component. Everything we need comes directly from our `useSingleCleaningJob` hook and is passed to the components that need them. Both the `CleaningJobCard` and `CleaningJobEditForm` use the same cleaning job, so we pass the `cleaningJob` object and `isOwner` boolean to the `CleaningJobCard` component and `cleaningId` to the `CleaningJobEditForm` component. At the moment, `CleaningJobEditForm` has its own logic on how to use that id to render its form properly, but that could probably be improved.

In fact, it would probably make sense to extract all of the logic within the `CleaningJobEditForm` into its own hook. Why don't we do that now?

Befor we move on, here's a codesandbox with all the code we've written up to this point:

<CodesandboxDisplay
  codesandboxLink={
    "https://codesandbox.io/s/phresh-frontend-part-11-the-usesinglecleaningjob-hook-y4gqe?file=/src/components/CleaningJobView/CleaningJobView.js"
  }

  }}
></CodesandboxDisplay>

Check to make sure everything is in order.

Once that's done, we'll get to building our `useCleaningJobForm` hook.

## The useCleaningJobForm hook

Go ahead and create a new file:

```bash
touch src/hooks/ui/useCleaningJobForm.js
```

Could this file have gone in the `hooks/cleanings` directory? Sure. But it's really more UI related, so we're placing it there instead.

Since the same fields are being used by the `CleaningJobCreateForm` and `CleaningJobEditForm` components, we'll design our hook to support both cases. As was the case with our `LoginForm` and `RegistrationForm`, there's quite a bit of shared logic between the two. Fortunately, we won't need to differentiate between the two situations explicitly like we did with our authentication form. We'll just use a `cleaningId` to determine the form's specifics.

Here's how we'll do it.

```jsx:title=<span>useCleaningJobForm.js</span>
import React, { useState, Fragment, useEffect } from "react"
import { useSingleCleaningJob } from "hooks/cleanings/useSingleCleaningJob"
import { EuiText } from "@elastic/eui"
import { extractErrorMessages } from "utils/errors"
import validation from "utils/validation"

const cleaningTypeOptions = [
  {
    value: "dust_up",
    inputDisplay: "Dust Up",
    dropdownDisplay: (
      <Fragment>
        <strong>Dust Up</strong>
        <EuiText size="s" color="subdued">
          <p className="euiTextColor--subdued">
            A minimal clean job. Dust shelves and mantels, tidy rooms, and sweep floors.
          </p>
        </EuiText>
      </Fragment>
    ),
  },
  {
    value: "spot_clean",
    inputDisplay: "Spot Clean",
    dropdownDisplay: (
      <Fragment>
        <strong>Spot Clean</strong>
        <EuiText size="s" color="subdued">
          <p className="euiTextColor--subdued">
            A standard clean job. Vacuum all indoor spaces, sanitize surfaces, and disinfect targeted areas. Bathrooms,
            tubs, and toilets can be added on for an additional charge.
          </p>
        </EuiText>
      </Fragment>
    ),
  },
  {
    value: "full_clean",
    inputDisplay: "Deep Clean",
    dropdownDisplay: (
      <Fragment>
        <strong>Deep Clean</strong>
        <EuiText size="s" color="subdued">
          <p className="euiTextColor--subdued">
            A complete clean job. Mop tile floors, scrub out tough spots, and a guaranteed clean residence upon
            completion. Dishes, pots, and pans included in this package.
          </p>
        </EuiText>
      </Fragment>
    ),
  },
]

export const useCleaningJobForm = (cleaningId) => {
  const { cleaningJob, isLoading, isUpdating, error } = useSingleCleaningJob(cleaningId)

  const [form, setForm] = useState({
    name: cleaningJob?.name || "",
    description: cleaningJob?.description || "",
    price: cleaningJob?.price || "",
    cleaning_type: cleaningJob?.cleaning_type || cleaningTypeOptions[0].value,
  })
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({})
  const [hasSubmitted, setHasSubmitted] = useState(false)
  const cleaningErrorList = extractErrorMessages(error)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (cleaningJob) {
      setForm((form) => ({ ...cleaningJob }))
    }
  }, [cleaningJob])

  const validateInput = (label, value) => {
    const isValid = validation?.[label] ? validation?.[label]?.(value) : true
    setErrors((errors) => ({ ...errors, [label]: !isValid }))
  }

  const onInputChange = (label, value) => {
    validateInput(label, value)
    setForm((state) => ({ ...state, [label]: value }))
  }

  const onCleaningTypeChange = (cleaning_type) => {
    setForm((state) => ({ ...state, cleaning_type }))
  }

  const getFormErrors = () => {
    const formErrors = []

    if (errors.form) {
      formErrors.push(errors.form)
    }

    if (hasSubmitted && cleaningErrorList.length) {
      return formErrors.concat(cleaningErrorList)
    }

    return formErrors
  }

  return {
    form,
    setForm,
    errors,
    isLoading,
    isUpdating,
    hasSubmitted,
    getFormErrors,
    setHasSubmitted,
    onInputChange,
    validateInput,
    onCleaningTypeChange,
    cleaningTypeOptions,
  }
}

```

This hook is much larger in size, but is actually very similar to our `useLoginAndRegistrationForm` hook. The main difference is that we have some shared UI used in the cleaning type dropdown. Right beneath the imports, we have the `cleaningTypeOptions` array which we have extracted from both components and placed here. With this one simple change, we've already removed 45 lines of code from our app with no reduction in functionality. That's a win.

We also take advantage of our freshly minted `useSingleCleaningJob` hook. The `useCleaningJobForm` takes in a single parameter - `cleaningId` - and passes it to `useSingleCleaningJob` to gain access to any currently existing cleaning jobs with that id. If the id doesn't exist, then no cleaning job will be returned. No harm no foul.

However, notice that our form state defaults to all the attributes of the `cleaningJob`, if it exists. In the case that no cleaning is present, we use empty strings and the first value in the `cleaningTypeOptions` array. The `useEffect` hook below our state initializations is run each time the `cleaningJob` value changes. When it receives a valid `cleanignJob`, it updates the form state with whatever attributes the cleaning resource already has. By doing this, we have made our form flexible enough to support existing cleaning jobs and ones that are yet to be made. That is why we'll be able to use this hook for both our `CleaningJobCreateForm` and `CleaningJobEditForm` components.

The rest of the hooks is code we've seen before, so we won't dive into it any further.

Let's see our work in action.

Open up the `CleaningJobEditForm` and make the following adjustments:

```jsx:title=<span>CleaningJobEditForm.js</span>
import React from "react"
import { connect } from "react-redux"
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"
import { Actions as cleaningActions } from "redux/cleanings"
import { useCleaningJobForm } from "hooks/ui/useCleaningJobForm"
import {
  EuiButton,
  EuiFieldText,
  EuiForm,
  EuiFormRow,
  EuiFieldNumber,
  EuiSuperSelect,
  EuiSpacer,
  EuiTextArea,
} from "@elastic/eui"
import styled from "styled-components"

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
`

function CleaningJobEditForm({ cleaningId, updateCleaning }) {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  const {
    form,
    errors,
    setErrors,
    isUpdating,
    getFormErrors,
    validateInput,
    onCleaningTypeChange,
    setHasSubmitted,
    onInputChange,
    cleaningTypeOptions
  } = useCleaningJobForm(cleaningId)

Like the other form components, our new version has been reduced in size significantly.

And in fact, the same will be true of the `CleaningJobCreateForm` component. Open up that file and modify it accordingly:

```jsx:title=<span>CleaningJobCreateForm.js</span>
import React from "react"
import { connect } from "react-redux"
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"
import { Actions as cleaningActions } from "redux/cleanings"
import { useCleaningJobForm } from "hooks/ui/useCleaningJobForm"
import {
  EuiButton,
  EuiFieldText,
  EuiForm,
  EuiFormRow,
  EuiFieldNumber,
  EuiSuperSelect,
  EuiSpacer,
  EuiTextArea
} from "@elastic/eui"

function CleaningJobCreateForm({ createCleaning }) {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  const {
    form,
    errors,
    setErrors,
    isLoading,
    validateInput,
    setHasSubmitted,
    getFormErrors,
    cleaningTypeOptions,
    onCleaningTypeChange,
    onInputChange
  } = useCleaningJobForm()

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    Object.keys(form).forEach((label) => validateInput(label, form[label]))

    if (!Object.values(form).every((value) => Boolean(value))) {
      setErrors((errors) => ({ ...errors, form: `You must fill out all fields.` }))
      return
    }

    setHasSubmitted(true)

    const res = await createCleaning({ new_cleaning: { ...form } })
    if (res.success) {
      const cleaningId = res.data?.id
      navigate(`/cleaning-jobs/${cleaningId}`)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <EuiForm
        component="form"
        onSubmit={handleSubmit}
        isInvalid={Boolean(getFormErrors().length)}
        error={getFormErrors()}
      >
        <EuiFormRow
          label="Job Title"
          helpText="What do you want cleaners to see first?"
          isInvalid={Boolean(errors.name)}
          error={`Please enter a valid name.`}
        >
          <EuiFieldText
            name="name"
            value={form.name}
            onChange={(e) => onInputChange(e.target.name, e.target.value)}
          />
        </EuiFormRow>

        <EuiFormRow label="Select a cleaning type">
          <EuiSuperSelect
            options={cleaningTypeOptions}
            valueOfSelected={form.cleaning_type}
            onChange={(value) => onCleaningTypeChange(value)}
            itemLayoutAlign="top"
            hasDividers
          />
        </EuiFormRow>

        <EuiFormRow
          label="Hourly Rate"
          helpText="List a reasonable price for each hour of work the employee logs."
          isInvalid={Boolean(errors.price)}
          error={`Price should match the general format: 9.99`}
        >
          <EuiFieldNumber

            onChange={(e) => onInputChange(e.target.name, e.target.value)}
          />
        </EuiFormRow>

        <EuiFormRow
          label="Job Description"
          helpText="What do you want prospective employees to know about this opportunity?"
          isInvalid={Boolean(errors.description)}
          error={`Please enter a valid input.`}
        >
          <EuiTextArea
            name="description"
            placeholder="I'm looking for..."
            value={form.description}
            onChange={(e) => onInputChange(e.target.name, e.target.value)}
          />
        </EuiFormRow>

        <EuiSpacer />

        <EuiButton type="submit" isLoading={isLoading} fill>
          Create Cleaning
        </EuiButton>
      </EuiForm>
    </>
  )
}

export default connect(null, {
  createCleaning: cleaningActions.createCleaningJob
})(CleaningJobCreateForm)

```

A similar feel here. An almost 100 line reduction in code. That is the magic of using custom hooks. Encapsulated logic, reduced component size, and organized ui management.

Take the newly updated components for a spin. Create a new cleaning job and then edit it.

It works, huh?

Let's put the finishing touches on our app by adding a success toast whenever the user updates a cleaning job.

Open back up the `redux/cleanings.js` file and add the following:

```jsx:title=<span>redux/cleanings.js</span>
// ...other code

Actions.updateCleaningJob = ({ cleaningId, cleaningUpdate }) => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    return dispatch(
      apiClient({
        url: `/cleanings/${cleaningId}/`,
        method: `PUT`,
        types: {
          REQUEST: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB,
          SUCCESS: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB_SUCCESS,
          FAILURE: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB_FAILURE,
        },
        options: {
          data: { cleaning_update: cleaningUpdate },
          params: {},
        },
        onSuccess: (res) => {
          // highlight-start
          dispatch(
            uiActions.addToast({
              id: `update-cleaning-success`,
              title: "Success!",
              color: "success",
              iconType: "checkInCircleFilled",
              toastLifeTimeMs: 15000,
              text: "Your cleaning job has been updated.",
            })
          )

          return {
            type: UPDATE_CLEANING_JOB_SUCCESS,
            success: true,
            status: res.status,
            data: res.data,
          }
          // highlight-end
        },
      })
    )
  }
}

// ...other code

```

In the `onSuccess` hook for our `updateCleaningJob` action creator, we take advantage of our global ui toast list and create a success toast for when cleaning jobs have been successfully updated.

Go in an edit another post and watch the fruits of our labor in action.

Here's a codesandbox with all the updates up to this point.

We have a lot of things that feel right here. Not everything works as before, however.

For instance, our cleaning jobs are still missing offers. We could return to our old method of fetching offers for a cleaning job when a component is mounted, but it probably makes more sense to populate cleaning jobs with their associated offers.

We'll handle that in our next post as we head back to FastAPI land for some backend updates.

## Wrapping Up and Resources

That should just about do it for our biggest frontend refactor yet. Our React application is becoming more organized and easier to reason about. We've also solidifed the core logic for handling cleaning jobs, so that we can move on to evaluations with confidence that the rest of our system is working effectively.

Next up, we'll start populating cleaning jobs received from our backend with offers the authenticated user is allowed to access.
